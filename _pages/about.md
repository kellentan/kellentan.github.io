I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) graduate student at Princeton University. My research interests are broadly in NLP; some areas I have worked on include figurative reasoning, contextual usage, synthetic data/dataset creation, and agentic frameworks. I am drawn towards simple yet effective approaches that can deepen our understanding and usage of language models.

I have been fortunate to intern at IBM Research (Summer 2024, Summer 2025) under the mentorship of [Dr. Anna Lisa Gentile](https://anligentile.github.io/), as well as Samsung Research America (Spring 2025) under the mentorship of [Dr. Ganesh Ramesh](https://ganeshramesh.github.io/). Previously, I received my undergraduate in Electrical Engineering at UCLA, where I was grateful to be mentored by [Prof. Fabien Scalzo](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~fab/). During this time, I also completed an internship at PerfuseAI (Summer 2021), a health startup. 

<!-- *Currently, I am on-leave from Princeton University. I am actively seeking research positions in either industry or academia. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to connect!*

In my free time, I enjoy playing strategy board and video games. I also enjoy watching television (animated cartoons and airplane documentaries), furthering my cooking skills, trying out new foods, and spending time with good friends. Recently I have gotten into card artistry and learning magic tricks.


Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaborating or mentorship. You can reach me through \[first name\]\[middle name\]@princeton.edu.-->
