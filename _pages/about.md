I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) graduate student at Princeton University, working with [Dr. Suma Bhat](https://publish.illinois.edu/sumapbhat/). My research interests are broadly in NLP, and I am particularly intrigued in two general directions: (1) how can we create high-quality text data for NLP tasks while reducing reliance on manual annotation, and (2) how can we better understand and improve NLP models' reasoning capabilities? I am drawn to methods that are simple, intuitive, and easy to understand; I am also a strong proponent of open-source and reproducible research. *N.B. I am actively looking for PhD positions for Fall 2025!*

During my time, I have been fortunate to intern at IBM Research (Summer 2024) under the mentorship of [Dr. Anna Lisa Gentile](https://anligentile.github.io/), and I am excited to be returning as an intern for Summer 2025. Previously, I completed my undergraduate in Electrical Engineering at UCLA, where I was grateful to be mentored by [Prof. Fabien Scalzo](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~fab/). During this time, I also completed an internship at PerfuseAI (Summer 2021), a health startup. 

<!-- In my free time, I enjoy playing strategy board and video games. I also enjoy watching television (animated cartoons and airplane documentaries), furthering my cooking skills, trying out new foods, and spending time with good friends. Recently I have gotten into card artistry and learning magic tricks.
